Diplomacy: embassies exist but travel for diplomats is long; conferences are rare and regional.

Trade: international trade volumes are much lower; trade is dominated by staples (food, fuel, raw materials).

Science: breakthroughs still happen but diffuse slowly; no global open-source or cloud-based research.

Warfare: naval and land power dominate; amphibious and blockade operations are decisive because no rapid aerial reinforcement exists.

Everyday life: people rely heavily on local production and markets; news arrives via radio, newspapers, and ships carrying printed goods.

Regional clusters matter most: areas with ports and arable land concentrate power. The Indian Ocean and South China Sea remain strategic because shipping dominates.

Small, wealthy coastal states (e.g., the UAE with 21M) can punch above their weight via resources and control of shipping nodes.

Former Western imperial states (UK, Europe, USA) are small in population and influence in your scenario â€” they may be politically independent but rarely global leaders.
